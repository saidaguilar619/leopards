        <p>Leopards are astoundingly strong. They are pound for 
        pound the strongest of the big cats. They are able to 
        climb trees, even when carrying heavy prey, and often 
        choose to rest on tree branches during the day. One reason 
        why leopards sometimes take their prey up in the trees is 
        to ensure lions or hyenas canâ€™t steal them.Leopards are
         renowned for their agility. They run up to 58km/h and 
         can leap 6m horizontally and 3m vertically. They are 
         also very strong swimmers.</p>
